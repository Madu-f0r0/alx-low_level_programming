Project 0x14-bit_manipulation is an introduction to bitwise operators and bit manipulation.
- Task 0 converts a binary number to an unsigned int
- Task 1 prints the binary representation of a number without using the '/' and '%' operators
- Task 2 returns the value of a bit at a given index
- Task 3 sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
- Task 4 sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
- Task 5 returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
